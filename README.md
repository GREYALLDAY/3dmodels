# 3D Models
=======
## I am using this repo to organize various 3D models for printing.

### Includes:

* Model files I've compiled from the Internet that I found interesting or useful
* Project files of models I am working on
* Project ideas
* Calculators: Tolerance
* Tests: Tolerance, diameter, radius


 Enjoy!
